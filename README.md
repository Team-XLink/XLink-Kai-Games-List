Are we missing a game? Is some of our information wrong? Open an issue here!

Anyone is free to update or share reports here, with the following requirements:
- You **must** have played the game over XLink Kai with at least one other player. Don't report games you have not tried to play.
- Follow the new issue template and remove any unnecessary text, but **please leave all formatting intact**.
- Search for a game first before adding a new issue; if you find an existing issue that is out of date or with incorrect information, reply to it with a copied/pasted new issue template. A curator will then edit the original with your findings.

When you update or add additional information in an issue, please reply to the issue indicating your changes.
